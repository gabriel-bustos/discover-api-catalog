# Caching Service API

## Overview

The Caching Service API provides endpoints for managing cached data to improve the performance and scalability of your applications. It allows you to store and retrieve data efficiently using key-value pairs.

## Base URL

Authentication is required for accessing the API. You need to include an API key in the request headers for authentication.

## Endpoints

  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

- Body:
  ```json
  {
    "key": "example_key",
    "value": "example_value",
    "expiration": "optional expiration time in seconds (default: 3600)"
  }
  ```

#### Response

## Errors

The API may return the following errors:

- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Something went wrong on the server.

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting to prevent abuse. Each API key is limited to a certain number of requests per minute.

## Example

```bash
# Store data
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/cache/store \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "example_key", "value": "example_value"}'

# Retrieve data
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/cache/retrieve/example_key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Delete data
curl -X DELETE https://api.example.com/cache/delete/example_key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Conclusion

The Caching Service API provides a simple and efficient way to manage cached data, improving the performance and scalability of your applications.
